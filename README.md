# Later Ladder

As an American fan of the Australian Football League (AFL) and Aussie rules football, one of the challenges I've faced is the inconvenience of checking current team standings without inadvertently spoiling match results that occurred overnight.

Later Ladder offers a solution: to display a team ladder that only refreshes as the user personally marks off the games they've watched. This unique feature ensures that you can stay informed about the current AFL standings while preserving the excitement of each match!

This is a work in progress. 

Status: You can now view a live version of Later Ladder at [LaterLadder.com](https://www.laterladder.com)! Core functionality is complete. Users can mark games as watched or unwatched and the team ladder updates according to those game results. Games do not have to be watched in any particular order.

- Games are updated in real time. When a game has finished, it can immediately be marked as watched.
- Guests can now use Later Ladder without registering for an account

Features coming soon:
- Mark all games watched/unwatched up to present
- Toggle to turn scores on/off for watched games
