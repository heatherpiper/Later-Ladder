# My AFL Ladder

As an American fan of Australian football, one of the challenges I've faced is the inconvenience of checking current team standings without inadvertently spoiling match results that occurred overnight.

My AFL Ladder offers a solution: to display a team ladder that only refreshes as the user personally marks off the games they've watched. This unique feature ensures that you can stay informed about the current standings while preserving the excitement of each match!

This is a work in progress.
